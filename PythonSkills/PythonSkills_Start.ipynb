Python runs all the statements you give to it in order. When it reaches the last line, if that line results in a value of some kind (like a quoted message as in \"Hello World\", or a numeric result 11), that value is output by Jupyter Notebook and labelled as an output using `Out[x]`. If you want results from before the last line to be printed, you have to use the `print` statement, which causes Jupyter Notebook to print whatever value is passed to the statement immediately.
