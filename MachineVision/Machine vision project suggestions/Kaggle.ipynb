    "A great source of many images is kaggle, which a data science competition platform. Many people upload loads of data there, oftten together with a goal. That is, they want to find a way to get information from the data. Some of these datasets contain images. For instance of healthy/infected leaves of crops ( https://www.kaggle.com/hadjerhamaidi/date-palm-data, https://www.kaggle.com/saroz014/plant-disease#dataset.zip) or images of crops an weeds (https://www.kaggle.com/limitpointinf0/crop-vs-weeds/data) or images of fresh and rotten fruits (https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification).
